SVEDIT(69)

NAME
	svedit -- edit the shared_value of a process

SYNOPSIS
	#include <unistd.h>

	int
	do_svedit(void);

DESCRIPTION
	svedit will determine or edit the shared_value.  It requires a message being sent to it with two int values. The first int is a rw variable to determine whether you are getting(rw = 0) or setting (rw = 1) the shared_value. The second int is the newVal if you're calling set_sv, or the pid if you're calling get_sv.  The status is then set depending on whether the pid is a currently existing process.  

RETURN VALUES
	Upon successful completion, do_svedit() returns the status of the system call.  SUCCESS = 0, FAILURE = 1. Another return value is the shared_value which is returned through mp_reply in the first int value of the message.

ERRORS
	None. Everything is perfect, because I am perfect.
